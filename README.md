# Login Page
## Login page using HTML, Css and JS 

#### This is a School project
The task was to create a login page using HTML and CSS. 
I made 3 different versions and added JavaScript to make it more interactive as I wanted to create a login page where the different pages slides up and down depending on what the user chooses. 

Features:

* This project in for desktop and larger screens only
* Semantic Html
* Css
* JavaScript
